## Introduction
In China, the amount of flour consumed by people in Henan in a year could fill a small lake. You can't imagine the love that people from Henan have for wheat-based foods. For them, noodles are like sausages for Germans, pizza for Italians, and burgers for Americans.

De Yuan Pure Soup Beef Noodles meet the excellent standards for hand-pulled noodles: one clear (soup), two whites (radishes), three greens (cilantro and garlic sprouts), four reds (chili), and five yellows (bright yellow noodles). This dish features hand-pulled noodles made on-site, and I highly recommend trying the buckwheat noodles. The chili oil is fragrant without being too spicy, and the noodles are chewy. After finishing, you’ll feel a warm sensation in your stomach—this is the aha moment.
