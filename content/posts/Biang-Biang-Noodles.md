## Introduction
Biang Biang noodles, a signature dish from Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, are famous for their distinctive wide, belt-like shape and the unique process of pouring searing hot oil over the noodles. The name "Biang Biang" is an onomatopoeia that mimics the sound made when the dough is slapped against the counter during the noodle-making process. This local specialty has become an international ambassador for Shaanxi's noodle culture.My hometown is Henan, a place where wheat-based dishes are the staple food. I absolutely love the hot oil-splashed noodles (Biang Biang noodles) from Xi'an, which typically comes with toppings like bean sprouts, tofu, and fresh greens. When the dish is just served and you start mixing it, you can smell the fragrant aroma of the chili oil, which makes your mouth water instantly. The vinegar seasoning gives the noodles a subtle sweet aftertaste, and the noodles themselves have a perfect chewy texture.
To try the most authentic Xi'an noodles at Han Si Yao restaurant, my friend and I patiently waited for an hour. Just remember to visit during meal times to experience this delicious dish.
