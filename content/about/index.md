## Who am I
My name is Luke Wang. I was born in a village in central China and have loved exploring since I was a child. As I grew up, I discovered my passion for travel, enjoying wandering around and seeing new places.


## Why I cteated this website
I've been to many destinations, tasted various local snacks, and witnessed diverse landscapes. Most importantly, I often find my aha moments during my travels, which allow me to experience the joys of life. I have lived in Shanghai for 15 years and know some authentic local cuisines and cultural insights. I hope to share these with others to help them find their own aha moments while traveling.
